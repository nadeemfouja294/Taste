Taste is a fully functional Android application using the power of Kotlin programming language. I developed a Food Recipes application, where user can browse recipes from various different kind of meal and diet types. This application will work with both Remote and local data sources.

Including:  
 * ViewModel
 * LiveData
 * Hilt (for dependency injection)
 * Kotlin Coroutines
 * Kotlin Extension Functions
 * Retrofit 2.0
 * Glide 4.0
 * Okhttp3
 * Room
 * Navigation
 * Client - Server Communication
 * Motion Layout
 * Constraint Layout
 * Modal Bottom Sheet
 * TestCases - Pending

 
All the dependencies are declared in the build.gradle file. No need to take some extra measure. 
Just import this project via Android Studio :)
