# Taste
Hello thanks for coming here, in this app I'm going to create a fully functional Android application using the power of Kotlin programming language.
I am going to develop a Food Recipes application, where user can browse recipes from various different kind of meal and diet types. 
This application will work with both Remote and local data sources. 
And for Remote data source I will use a third party API for food recipes, called Spoonacular.
I'm going to establish a connection between the app and the server. 
So basically I will send GET Request to our API and receive a list of food recipes as a Response. 
Also this app will be able to handle no internet connection, and store or cache the data localy to our database when it's needed.
Also from this application the user will be able to search recipes from our API directly. 
So if you have your favorite flavor you can search it here and probably you'll find many amazing recipes. 
Next this app will have Favorites Fragment where user can save  favorite recipes for later .
